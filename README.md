# JUMP Cell Painting Datasets

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/552371375.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/552371375)

This is a collection of [Cell Painting](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/cell-painting) image datasets generated by the [JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/), funded in part by a grant from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.

This repository contains notebooks and instructions to work with the datasets.

All the data is hosted on the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS ([https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/)). If you'd like to take a look at (a subset of) the data interactively, the [JUMP-CP Data Explorer](https://phenaid.ardigen.com/jumpcpexplorer/) by Ardigen and the [JUMP-CP Data Portal](https://www.springdiscovery.com/jump-cp) by Spring Discovery provide portals to do so.

## Details about the data

Currently, this collection comprises 4 datasets:

- The principal dataset of 116k chemical and >15k genetic perturbations the partners created in tandem (`cpg0016`), split across 12 data-generating centers. Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells are used.
- 3 pilot datasets created to test: different perturbation conditions (`cpg0000`, including different cell types), staining conditions (`cpg0001`), and microscopes (`cpg0002`).

### What’s available now

- All data [components](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery/blob/main/folder_structure.md) of the three pilots.
- Most data components (images, raw CellProfiler output, single-cell profiles, aggregated CellProfiler profiles) from 12 sources for the principal dataset. Each source corresponds to a unique data generating center (except `source_7` and `source_13`, which were from the same center).
- First draft of [metadata](metadata/README.md) files.
- A [notebook](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/blob/update-readme/sample_notebook.ipynb) to load and inspect the data currently available in the principal dataset.
- A [tutorial](https://broadinstitute.github.io/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/howto/tutorial_basic.html) to load the different subsets of data in the principal dataset, each available as a single dataframe. The URLs to the subsets are [here](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/blob/main/profiles_index.csv). Snakemake workflows for producing these assembled profiles are available [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/jump-profiling-recipe/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

**Please note: At present in the principal dataset (`cpg0016`), some compounds will be missing replicates, and a full QC of the dataset is pending. We don’t recommend performing any analysis with the principal dataset the full QC of the dataset is complete. The other datasets are complete.**

### What’s coming up

- Extending the metadata and notebooks to the three pilots so that all these datasets can be quickly loaded together ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/93)).
- Curated annotations for the compounds, obtained from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and other sources ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/78)).
- The remaining data [components](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery/blob/main/folder_structure.md) (normalized profiles, feature selected profiles, treatment-level consensus profiles, quality control results) ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/79)).
- Deep learning [embeddings](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/efficientnet_v2_imagenet1k_s/feature_vector/2) using a pre-trained neural network for all 4 datasets ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/50)).

## How to load the data: notebooks and folder structure

See the [sample notebook](sample_notebook.ipynb) to learn more about how to load the data in the principal dataset.

To get set up to run the notebook, first install the python dependencies and activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   # install pipenv if you don't have it already https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```

See the typical [folder structure](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery/blob/main/folder_structure.md) for datasets in the Cell Painting Gallery.
Please [note](README.md#whats-available-now) that not all components are currently available.

This new resource https://broad.io/jump will include vignettes demonstrating how to work with JUMP data. Currently, it contains one [tutorial](https://broadinstitute.github.io/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/howto/tutorial_basic.html) which demonstrates how to load the different subsets of data within `cpg0016`.
