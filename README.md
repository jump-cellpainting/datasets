# JUMP Cell Painting Datasets

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/552371375.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/552371375)

This is a collection of [Cell Painting](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/cell-painting) image datasets generated by the [JUMP-Cell Painting Consortium](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/), funded in part by a grant from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.

This repository contains notebooks and instructions to work with the datasets.

All the data is hosted on the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS ([https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/](https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/)). If you'd like to take a look at (a subset of) the data interactively, the [JUMP-CP Data Explorer](https://phenaid.ardigen.com/jumpcpexplorer/) by Ardigen and the [JUMP-CP Data Portal](https://www.springdiscovery.com/jump-cp) by Spring Discovery provide portals to do so.

## Details about the data

This collection comprises 4 datasets:

- The principal dataset of 116k chemical and >15k genetic perturbations the partners created in tandem (`cpg0016`), split across 12 data-generating centers. Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells are used.
- 3 pilot datasets created to test: different perturbation conditions (`cpg0000`, including different cell types), staining conditions (`cpg0001`), and microscopes (`cpg0002`).

### What’s available now

- All data [components](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery/blob/main/documentation/data_structure.md) of the three pilots.
- Most data components (images, raw CellProfiler output, single-cell profiles, aggregated CellProfiler profiles) from 12 sources for the principal dataset. Each source corresponds to a unique data generating center (except `source_7` and `source_13`, which were from the same center).
- All key [metadata](metadata/README.md) files.
- A [notebook](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/blob/main/sample_notebook.ipynb) to load and inspect the data currently available in the principal dataset.
- Different subsets of data in the principal dataset, assembled into single parquet files. The URLs to the subsets are [here](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets/blob/main/manifests/profile_index.csv). The corresponding folders for each contain all the data levels (e.g. this [folder](https://cellpainting-gallery.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#cpg0016-jump-assembled/source_all/workspace/profiles/jump-profiling-recipe_2024_a917fa7/ORF/profiles_wellpos_cc_var_mad_outlier_featselect_sphering_harmony/)). Snakemake workflows for producing these assembled profiles are available [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/jump-profiling-recipe/releases/tag/v0.1.0). We recommend working with the the `all` or `all_interpretable` subsets -- they contain all three data modalities in single dataframe. Note that cross-modality matching is still poor (ORF-CRISPR, COMPOUND-CRISPR, COMPOUND-ORF), but within modality generally works well. 
- A [tutorial](https://broadinstitute.github.io/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/howto/1_retrieve_profiles.html) to load these subsets of data.
- Other [tutorials](https://broad.io/jump) to work with `cpg0016`.

### What’s coming up

- Extending the metadata and notebooks to the three pilots so that all these datasets can be quickly loaded together ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/93)).
- Curated annotations for the compounds, obtained from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and other sources ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/78)).
- Deep learning [embeddings](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/efficientnet_v2_imagenet1k_s/feature_vector/2) using a pre-trained neural network for all 4 datasets ([issue](https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/datasets-private/issues/50)).
- Methods and tools to simplify access to the data/metadata ([`cpgdata`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cpg/tree/main/cpgdata), [`jump-portraits`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_portrait), [`jump-babel`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_babel)).
